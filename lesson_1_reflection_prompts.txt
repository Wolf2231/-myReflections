How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It conveniently shows made changes in few lines rather than viewing the whole file,
    which might contain thousands of lines, in turn it saves time spent spoting changes 
    made that could have cause bugs in a programme, developement of a text or recognize 
    different commit from different editors.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It will be easier to roll back in time and reprogramme using different paths
    and comparing differen versions. It will be really motivating to notice the
    developement on the same file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    In Git its pros are that I am the one who decide if there is a change that
    worth commit without making a long clogged list of non core changes. 
    Unlike Git, Google docs might make 100s of copies where only 1 change 
    was a core change, But it would be more favourable since it is need to be edited
    multiple times online.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Clearly because when a part of a file in a programme is changed its most likey
    the logic in other files are changed as well. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Its a great way to observe the changes made in multiple files on multiple commits,
    which would have required a lot of time and a great amount of complexity and
    will eventually fail due to many unrecognised diffs. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It will for sure help me do greater and deeper changes without worrying of not being 
    able to rollback.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would use it for my android app project, I will commit when any new feature is added.
