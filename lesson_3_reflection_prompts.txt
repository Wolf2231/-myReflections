When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your local?

   It's always convenient to have a copy of your files online as a backup. Plus if it's a
   project,it will be convenient to access and keep working on it from anywhere and anytime.
   And since it's on GitHub as its made for collaborative projects, it will be an extremely 
   useful tool for working on projects that require multiple parties, plus it could be used 
   with companies and jobs that require collaborative projects. Really, their are many 
   practices that remote repositories could be extremely useful.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   I'm not really sure why not.
   
Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead
of another?

   Forks are clones made of repo in the GitHub server, clones are copies of a repo.
   Branches are parallel commit on a reposiory.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   This way when we push or fetch data the only commit that will be transfered are the ones
   that are out of sync.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?

   I would use a shared PC in school or work or maybe share a flashdrive. Maybe we would
   use google drive to keep our files up to date. Either way I cant imagine that it could
   be any better then using Git and GitHub.
